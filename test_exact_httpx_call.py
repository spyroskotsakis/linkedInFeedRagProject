Document 2 (by Fortune): Aravind Srinivas wanted a simple answer. If Google had given him one, things might have turned out differently‚Äîfor Srinivas and for Google.

It was the fall of 2022, weeks before OpenAI would debut its viral AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Srinivas, then 28, was an ambitious AI researcher with a PhD from UC Berkeley and prestigious internships at OpenAI and Google's AI labs under his belt, plus a year working full-time for OpenAI after earning his doctorate. Now he'd left that plum job to launch a startup with three cofounders, all AI experts.

Weeks later, ChatGPT launched. Seven days after that, Srinivas and his cofounders debuted their San Francisco‚Äìbased company and its breakthrough product. They called both‚Äîborrowing a machine-learning term for how well an AI model makes predictions. Even amid the buzz around ChatGPT, Perplexity gained traction among Silicon Valley's elite and, through word of mouth, among consultants, analysts, and journalists.
