# Captchas

CAPTCHA, short for _Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart_ , is explicitly designed to prevent automation, so do not try\! There are two primary strategies to get around CAPTCHA checks:

  * Disable CAPTCHAs in your test environment   * Add a hook to allow tests to bypass the CAPTCHA
