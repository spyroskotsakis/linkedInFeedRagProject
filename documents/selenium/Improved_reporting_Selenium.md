# Improved reporting

Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit test frameworks is a good start. Most unit test frameworks have reports that can generate xUnit or HTML formatted reports. xUnit reports are popular for importing results to a Continuous Integration \(CI\) server like Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, etc. Here are some links for more information regarding report outputs for several languages.
