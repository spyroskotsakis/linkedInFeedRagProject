# About this documentation

These docs, like the code itself, are maintained 100% by volunteers within the Selenium community. Many have been using it since its inception, but many more have only been using it for a short while, and have given their time to help improve the onboarding experience for new users.

If there is an issue with the documentation, we want to know\! The best way to communicate an issue is to visit [https://github.com/seleniumhq/seleniumhq.github.io/issues](https://github.com/seleniumhq/seleniumhq.github.io/issues) and search to see whether or not the issue has been filed already. If not, feel free to open one\!

Many members of the community are present at the \#selenium Libera chat at [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/). Feel free to drop in and ask questions and if you get help which you think could be of use within these documents, be sure to add your contribution\! We can update these documents, but it is much easier for everyone when we get contributions from outside the normal committers.
