# WebDriver

WebDriver drives a browser natively; learn more about it.

WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server. It marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.

Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just _WebDriver_.

Selenium WebDriver is a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/)

  * WebDriver is designed as a simple and more concise programming interface.

  * WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API.

  * It drives the browser effectively.
