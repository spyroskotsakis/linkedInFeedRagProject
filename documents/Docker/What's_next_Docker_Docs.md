The following sections provide step-by-step guides to help you understand core Docker concepts, building images, and running containers.

## The basics

Get started learning the core concepts of containers, images, registries, and Docker Compose.

### [What is a container?Learn how to run your first container.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/)

### [What is an image?Learn the basics of image layers.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-an-image/)

### [What is a registry?Learn about container registries, explore their interoperability, and interact with registries.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-registry/)

### [What is Docker Compose?Gain a better understanding of Docker Compose.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-docker-compose/)

## Building images

Craft optimized container images with Dockerfiles, build cache, and multi-stage builds.

### [Understanding image layersLearn about the layers of container images.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/understanding-image-layers/)

### [Writing a DockerfileLearn how to create an image using a Dockerfile.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)

### [Build, tag and publish an imageLearn how to build, tag, and publish an image to Docker Hub or any other registry.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/)

### [Using the build cacheLearn about the build cache, what changes invalidate the cache, and how to effectively use the build cache.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/using-the-build-cache/)

### [Multi-stage buildsGet a better understanding of multi-stage builds and their benefits.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/multi-stage-builds/)

## Running containers

Master essential techniques for exposing ports, overriding defaults, persisting data, sharing files, and managing multi-container applications.

### [Publishing portsUnderstand the significance of publishing and exposing ports in Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/)

### [Overriding container defaultsLearn how to override the container defaults using the `docker run` command.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/overriding-container-defaults/)

### [Persisting container dataLearn the significance of data persistence in Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/persisting-container-data/)

### [Sharing local files with containersExplore the various storage options available in Docker and their common usage.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/sharing-local-files/)

### [Multi-container applicationsLearn the significance of multi-container applications and how they're different from single-container applications.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/multi-container-applications/)
