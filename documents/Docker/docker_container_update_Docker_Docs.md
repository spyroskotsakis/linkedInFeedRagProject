# docker container update

Description| Update configuration of one or more containers   ---|---   Usage| `docker container update [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]`   AliasesAn alias is a short or memorable alternative for a longer command.| `docker update`      ## Description

The `docker update` command dynamically updates container configuration. You can use this command to prevent containers from consuming too many resources from their Docker host. With a single command, you can place limits on a single container or on many. To specify more than one container, provide space-separated list of container names or IDs.

With the exception of the `--kernel-memory` option, you can specify these options on a running or a stopped container. On kernel version older than 4.6, you can only update `--kernel-memory` on a stopped container or on a running container with kernel memory initialized.

> Warning >  > The `docker update` and `docker container update` commands are not supported for Windows containers.

## Options

Option| Default| Description   ---|---|---   `--blkio-weight`| | Block IO \(relative weight\), between 10 and 1000, or 0 to disable \(default 0\)      `--cpu-period`| | Limit CPU CFS \(Completely Fair Scheduler\) period   `--cpu-quota`| | Limit CPU CFS \(Completely Fair Scheduler\) quota   `--cpu-rt-period`| | API 1.25+ Limit the CPU real-time period in microseconds   `--cpu-rt-runtime`| | API 1.25+ Limit the CPU real-time runtime in microseconds   `-c, --cpu-shares`| | CPU shares \(relative weight\)   `--cpus`| | API 1.29+ Number of CPUs   `--cpuset-cpus`| | CPUs in which to allow execution \(0-3, 0,1\)   `--cpuset-mems`| | MEMs in which to allow execution \(0-3, 0,1\)   `-m, --memory`| | Memory limit   `--memory-reservation`| | Memory soft limit   `--memory-swap`| | Swap limit equal to memory plus swap: -1 to enable unlimited swap   `--pids-limit`| | API 1.40+ Tune container pids limit \(set -1 for unlimited\)   `--restart`| | Restart policy to apply when a container exits      ## Examples

The following sections illustrate ways to use this command.

### Update a container's cpu-shares \(--cpu-shares\)

To limit a container's cpu-shares to 512, first identify the container name or ID. You can use `docker ps` to find these values. You can also use the ID returned from the `docker run` command. Then, do the following:               $ docker update --cpu-shares 512 abebf7571666     

### Update a container with cpu-shares and memory \(-m, --memory\)

To update multiple resource configurations for multiple containers:               $ docker update --cpu-shares 512 -m 300M abebf7571666 hopeful_morse     

### Update a container's kernel memory constraints \(--kernel-memory\)

You can update a container's kernel memory limit using the `--kernel-memory` option. On kernel version older than 4.6, this option can be updated on a running container only if the container was started with `--kernel-memory`. If the container was started without `--kernel-memory` you need to stop the container before updating kernel memory.

> Note >  > The `--kernel-memory` option has been deprecated since Docker 20.10.

For example, if you started a container with this command:               $ docker run -dit --name test --kernel-memory 50M ubuntu bash     

You can update kernel memory while the container is running:               $ docker update --kernel-memory 80M test     

If you started a container without kernel memory initialized:               $ docker run -dit --name test2 --memory 300M ubuntu bash     

Update kernel memory of running container `test2` will fail. You need to stop the container before updating the `--kernel-memory` setting. The next time you start it, the container uses the new value.

Kernel version newer than \(include\) 4.6 does not have this limitation, you can use `--kernel-memory` the same way as other options.

### Update a container's restart policy \(--restart\)

You can change a container's restart policy on a running container. The new restart policy takes effect instantly after you run `docker update` on a container.

To update restart policy for one or more containers:               $ docker update --restart=on-failure:3 abebf7571666 hopeful_morse     

Note that if the container is started with `--rm` flag, you cannot update the restart policy for it. The `AutoRemove` and `RestartPolicy` are mutually exclusive for the container.
