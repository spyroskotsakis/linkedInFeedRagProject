# Securing your software supply chain with Docker Scout

Table of contents

* * *

When container images are insecure, significant risks can arise. Around 60% of organizations have reported experiencing at least one security breach or vulnerability incident within a year, [resulting in operational disruption](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2023/09/21/2023-global-cloud-threat-report-cloud-attacks-are-lightning-fast). These incidents often result in considerable downtime, with 44% of affected companies experiencing over an hour of downtime per event. The financial impact is substantial, with [the average data breach cost reaching $4.45 million](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach). This highlights the critical importance of maintaining robust container security measures.

Docker Scout enhances container security by providing automated vulnerability detection and remediation, addressing insecure container images, and ensuring compliance with security standards.

## What you'll learn

  * Define Secure Software Supply Chain \(SSSC\)   * Review SBOMs and how to use them   * Detect and monitor vulnerabilities

## Tools integration

Works well with Docker Desktop, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and other CI solutions.

## Whoâs this for?

  * DevOps engineers who need to integrate automated security checks into CI/CD pipelines to enhance the security and efficiency of their workflows.   * Developers who want to use Docker Scout to identify and remediate vulnerabilities early in the development process, ensuring the production of secure container images.   * Security professionals who must enforce security compliance, conduct vulnerability assessments, and ensure the overall security of containerized applications.
