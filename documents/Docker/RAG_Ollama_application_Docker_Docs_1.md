# Build a RAG application using Ollama and Docker

* * *

The Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) guide teaches you how to containerize an existing RAG application using Docker. The example application is a RAG that acts like a sommelier, giving you the best pairings between wines and food. In this guide, youâll learn how to:

  * Containerize and run a RAG application   * Set up a local environment to run the complete RAG stack locally for development

Start by containerizing an existing RAG application.
