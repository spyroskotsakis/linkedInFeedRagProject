There are two types of extensions available in the Extensions Marketplace:

  * Docker-reviewed extensions   * Self-published extensions

Docker-reviewed extensions are manually reviewed by the Docker Extensions team to ensure an extra level of trust and quality. They appear as **Reviewed** in the Marketplace.

Self-published extensions are autonomously published by extension developers and go through an automated validation process. They appear as **Not reviewed** in the Marketplace.

## Install an extension

> Note >  > For some extensions, a separate account needs to be created before use.

To install an extension:

  1. Open Docker Desktop.   2. From the Docker Desktop Dashboard, select the **Extensions** tab. The Extensions Marketplace opens on the **Browse** tab.   3. Browse the available extensions. You can sort the list of extensions by **Recently added** , **Most installed** , or alphabetically. Alternatively, use the **Content** or **Categories** drop-down menu to search for extensions by whether they have been reviewed or not, or by category.   4. Choose an extension and select **Install**.

From here, you can select **Open** to access the extension or install additional extensions. The extension also appears in the left-hand menu and in the **Manage** tab.

## Update an extension

You can update any extension outside of Docker Desktop releases. To update an extension to the latest version, navigate to the Docker Desktop Dashboard and select the **Manage** tab.

The **Manage** tab displays with all your installed extensions. If an extension has a new version available, it displays an **Update** button.

## Uninstall an extension

You can uninstall an extension at any time.

> Note >  > Any data used by the extension that's stored in a volume must be manually deleted.

  1. Navigate to the Docker Desktop Dashboard and select the **Manage** tab. This displays a list of extensions you've installed.   2. Select the ellipsis to the right of extension you want to uninstall.   3. Select **Uninstall**.
