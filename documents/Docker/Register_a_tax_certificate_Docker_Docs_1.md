If you're a customer in the United States and you're exempt from sales tax, you can register a valid tax exemption certificate with Docker's Support team. If you're a global customer subject to VAT, make sure that you provide your [VAT number](https://docs.docker.com/billing/history/#include-your-vat-number-on-your-invoice) including your VAT country prefix.

> Important >  > For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025. >  > To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated.
