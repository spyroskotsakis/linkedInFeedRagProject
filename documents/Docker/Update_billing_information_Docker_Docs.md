You can update the billing information for your personal account or for an organization. When you update your billing information, these changes apply to future billing invoices. Note that you can't update an existing invoice, including paid and unpaid invoices.

The billing information provided appears on all your billing invoices. The email address provided is where Docker sends all invoices and other billing-related communication.
