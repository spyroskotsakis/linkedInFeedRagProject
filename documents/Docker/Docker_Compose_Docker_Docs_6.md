# Defining and running multi-container applications with Docker Compose

Table of contents

* * *

Developers face challenges with multi-container Docker applications, including complex configuration, dependency management, and maintaining consistent environments. Networking, resource allocation, data persistence, logging, and monitoring add to the difficulty. Security concerns and troubleshooting issues further complicate the process, requiring effective tools and practices for efficient management.

Docker Compose solves the problem of managing multi-container Docker applications by providing a simple way to define, configure, and run all the containers needed for an application using a single YAML file. This approach helps developers to easily set up, share, and maintain consistent development, testing, and production environments, ensuring that complex applications can be deployed with all their dependencies and services properly configured and orchestrated.

## What youâll learn

  * What Docker Compose is and what it does   * How to define services   * Use cases for Docker Compose   * How things would be different without Docker Compose

## Whoâs this for?

  * Developers and DevOps engineers who need to define, manage, and orchestrate multi-container Docker applications efficiently across multiple environments.   * Development teams that want to increase productivity by streamlining development workflows and reducing setup time.

## Tools integration

Works well with Docker CLI, CI/CD tools, and container orchestration tools.
