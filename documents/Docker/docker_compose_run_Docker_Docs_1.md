# docker compose run

Description| Run a one-off command on a service   ---|---   Usage| `docker compose run [OPTIONS] SERVICE [COMMAND] [ARGS...]`      ## Description

Runs a one-time command against a service.

The following command starts the `web` service and runs `bash` as its command:               $ docker compose run web bash     

Commands you use with run start in new containers with configuration defined by that of the service, including volumes, links, and other details. However, there are two important differences:

First, the command passed by `run` overrides the command defined in the service configuration. For example, if the `web` service configuration is started with `bash`, then `docker compose run web python app.py` overrides it with `python app.py`.

The second difference is that the `docker compose run` command does not create any of the ports specified in the service configuration. This prevents port collisions with already-open ports. If you do want the serviceâs ports to be created and mapped to the host, specify the `--service-ports`               $ docker compose run --service-ports web python manage.py shell     

Alternatively, manual port mapping can be specified with the `--publish` or `-p` options, just as when using docker run:               $ docker compose run --publish 8080:80 -p 2022:22 -p 127.0.0.1:2021:21 web python manage.py shell     

If you start a service configured with links, the run command first checks to see if the linked service is running and starts the service if it is stopped. Once all the linked services are running, the run executes the command you passed it. For example, you could run:               $ docker compose run db psql -h db -U docker     

This opens an interactive PostgreSQL shell for the linked `db` container.

If you do not want the run command to start linked containers, use the `--no-deps` flag:               $ docker compose run --no-deps web python manage.py shell     

If you want to remove the container after running while overriding the containerâs restart policy, use the `--rm` flag:               $ docker compose run --rm web python manage.py db upgrade     

This runs a database upgrade script, and removes the container when finished running, even if a restart policy is specified in the service configuration.
