Availability: Early Access 

The Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot provides a chat interface that you can use to interact with the Docker agent. You can ask questions and get help Dockerizing your project.

The Docker agent is trained to understand Docker-related questions, and provide guidance on Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files, and other Docker assets.

## Setup

Before you can start interacting with the Docker agent, make sure you've [installed](https://docs.docker.com/copilot/install/) the extension for your organization.

### Enable GitHub Copilot chat in your editor or IDE

For instructions on how to use the Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot in your editor, see:

  * [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-ides/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide?tool=vscode)   * [Visual Studio](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-ides/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide?tool=visualstudio)   * [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/reference/using-github-copilot-in-github-codespaces)

### Verify the setup

You can verify that the extension has been properly installed by typing `@docker` in the Copilot Chat window. As you type, you should see the Docker agent appear in the chat interface.
