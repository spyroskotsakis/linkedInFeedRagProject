Before you begin setting up Laravel with Docker Compose, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

## Docker and Docker Compose

You need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Docker allows you to containerize applications, and Docker Compose helps you manage multi-container applications.

  * Docker: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.   * Docker Compose: Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop, but you can also follow the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if needed.

## Basic understanding of Docker and containers

A fundamental understanding of Docker and how containers work will be helpful. If you're new to Docker, consider reviewing the [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) to familiarize yourself with containerization concepts.

## Basic knowledge of Laravel

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Laravel and PHP. Familiarity with Laravelâs command-line tools, such as [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/artisan), and its project structure is important for following the instructions.

  * Laravel CLI: You should be comfortable using Laravelâs command-line tool \(`artisan`\).   * Laravel Project Structure: Familiarize yourself with Laravelâs folder structure \(`app`, `config`, `routes`, `tests`, etc.\).
