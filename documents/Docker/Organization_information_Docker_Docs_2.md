Learn how to update your organization information using the Admin Console.

## Update organization information

General organization information appears on your organization landing page in the Admin Console.

This information includes:

  * Organization Name   * Company   * Location   * Website   * Gravatar email: To add an avatar to your Docker account, create a [Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/) and upload an avatar. Next, add your Gravatar email to your Docker account settings. It may take some time for your avatar to update in Docker.

To edit this information:

  1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) and select your organization.   2. Enter or update your organizationâs details, then select **Save**.
