Docker Build is one of Docker Engine's most used features. Whenever you are creating an image you are using Docker Build. Build is a key part of your software development life cycle allowing you to package and bundle your code and ship it anywhere.

Docker Build is more than a command for building images, and it's not only about packaging your code. It's a whole ecosystem of tools and features that support not only common workflow tasks but also provides support for more complex and advanced scenarios.
