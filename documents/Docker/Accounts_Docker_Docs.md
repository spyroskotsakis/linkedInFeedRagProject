### What is a Docker ID?

A Docker ID is a username for your Docker account that lets you access Docker products. To create a Docker ID you need one of the following:

  * An email address   * A social account   * A GitHub account

Your Docker ID must be between 4 and 30 characters long, and can only contain numbers and lowercase letters. You can't use any special characters or spaces.

For more information, see [Create a Docker ID](http://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/).

### Can I change my Docker ID?

No. You can't change your Docker ID once it's created. If you need a different Docker ID, you must create a new Docker account with a new Docker ID.

Docker IDs can't be reused after deactivation.

### What if my Docker ID is taken?

All Docker IDs are first-come, first-served except for companies that have a U.S. Trademark on a username.

If you have a trademark for your namespace, [Docker Support](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/) can retrieve the Docker ID for you.

### What's an organization name or namespace?

The organization name, sometimes referred to as the organization namespace or the organization ID, is the unique identifier of a Docker organization. The organization name can't be the same as an existing Docker ID.

### Who is an organization owner?

An organization owner is a member who has administrator permissions. They have full access to private repositories, all teams, billing information, and organization settings.

For more information on the organization owner role, see [Roles and permissions](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions/).

### Can I configure multiple SSO identity providers \(IdPs\) to authenticate users to a single org?

Yes. Docker SSO supports multiple IdP configurations. For more information, see [Configure SSO](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/configure/) and [SSO FAQs](https://docs.docker.com/security/faqs/single-sign-on/faqs/).

### What is a service account?

Service accounts were deprecated on December 10, 2024. Existing Service Account agreements will be honored until their current term expires, but new purchases or renewals of service accounts are no longer available and customers must renew under a new subscription.

For similar functionality, transition to [Organization access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/access-tokens/).

### Can I delete or deactivate a Docker account for another user?

Only someone with access to the Docker account can deactivate the account. For more details, see [Deactivating an account](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/deactivate-account/).
