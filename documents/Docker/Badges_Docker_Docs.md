You can also make a badge a link.

[badge with a link](https://docs.docker.com/contribute/)

### Usage guidelines

We use badges to indicate new content and product content in various stages of the release lifecycle:

  * The violet badge to highlight new early access or experimental content   * The blue badge to highlight beta content   * The green badge to highlight new content that is either GA or not product-related content, such as guides/learning paths

Best practice is to use this badge for no longer than 2 months post release of the feature.

### Markup               {{< badge color=amber text="amber badge" >}}     [{{< badge color="blue" text="badge with a link" >}}](../overview.md)
