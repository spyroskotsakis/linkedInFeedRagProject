This page provides an overview of endpoints that are deprecated in Docker Verified Publisher API.

## Endpoint deprecation policy

As changes are made to Docker there may be times when existing endpoints need to be removed or replaced with newer endpoints. Before an existing endpoint is removed it is labeled as "deprecated" within the documentation. After some time it may be removed.

## Deprecated endpoints

The following table provides an overview of the current status of deprecated endpoints:

**Deprecated** : the endpoint is marked "deprecated" and should no longer be used.

The endpoint may be removed, disabled, or change behavior in a future release.

**Removed** : the endpoint was removed, disabled, or hidden.
