The Compose Specification is the latest and recommended version of the Compose file format. It helps you define a [Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/compose-application-model/) which is used to configure your Docker applicationâs services, networks, volumes, and more.

Legacy versions 2.x and 3.x of the Compose file format were merged into the Compose Specification. It is implemented in versions 1.27.0 and above \(also known as Compose v2\) of the Docker Compose CLI.

The Compose Specification on Docker Docs is the Docker Compose implementation. If you wish to implement your own version of the Compose Specification, see the [Compose Specification repository](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).

Use the following links to navigate key sections of the Compose Specification.
