Docker Hardened Images \(DHI\) are designed to provide flexibility and robust support for enterprise environments, allowing teams to tailor images to their specific needs while ensuring security and compliance.

## Enterprise-grade support and SLA-backed security updates

Docker provides comprehensive enterprise support for DHI users, ensuring rapid response to security threats and operational issues:

  * Enterprise support: Access to Docker's support team, with response times designed to safeguard mission-critical applications and maintain operational continuity.

  * SLA-backed CVE mitigation: Docker aims to address Critical and High severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVEs\) within 7 working days of an upstream fix becoming available, with some exceptions. Faster than typical industry response times and backed by an enterprise-grade SLA, so your teams can rely on timely fixes to keep workloads secure.

This level of support ensures that organizations can rely on DHI for their mission-critical applications, with the assurance that security and stability are maintained proactively.
