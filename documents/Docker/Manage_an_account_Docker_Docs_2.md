You can centrally manage your Docker account settings using Docker Home. Here you can also take administrative actions for your account and manage your account security.

> Tip >  > If your account is associated with an organization that enforces single sign-on \(SSO\), you may not have permissions to update your account settings. You must contact your administrator to update your settings.

## Update general settings

  1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).   2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.

From the Account settings page, you can take any of the following actions.

### Update account information

Account information is visible on your account profile in Docker Hub. You can update the following account information:

  * Full name   * Company   * Location   * Website   * Gravatar email: To add an avatar to your Docker account, create a [Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/) and create your avatar. Next, add your Gravatar email to your Docker account settings. It may take some time for your avatar to update in Docker.

Make your changes here, then select **Save** to save your settings.

### Update email address

To update your email address, select **Email** :

  1. Enter your new email address.   2. Enter your password to confirm the change.   3. Select **Send verification email** to send a verification email to your new email address.

Once you verify your email address, your account information will update.

### Change your password

You can change your password by initiating a password reset via email.

To change your password, select **Password** and then **Reset password**. Follow the instructions in the password reset email.

## Manage security settings

To update your two-factor authentication \(2FA\) settings, select **2FA**. For information on two-factor authentication \(2FA\) for your account, see [Enable two-factor authentication](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/2fa/) to get started.

To manage personal access tokens, select **Personal access tokens**. For information on personal access tokens, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/).

## Manage connected accounts

You can unlink Google or GitHub accounts that are linked to your Docker account using the Account settings page:

  1. Select **Connected accounts**.   2. Select **Disconnect** on your connected account.   3. To fully unlink your Docker account, you must also unlink Docker from Google or GitHub. See Google or GitHub's documentation for more information:      * [Manage connections between your Google Account and third-parties](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13533235?hl=en)      * [Reviewing and revoking authorization of GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps)
