Container images consist of layers and software packages, which are susceptible to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can compromise the security of containers and applications.

Docker Scout is a solution for proactively enhancing your software supply chain security. By analyzing your images, Docker Scout compiles an inventory of components, also known as a Software Bill of Materials \(SBOM\). The SBOM is matched against a continuously updated vulnerability database to pinpoint security weaknesses.

Docker Scout is a standalone service and platform that you can interact with using Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, the Docker CLI, and the Docker Scout Dashboard. Docker Scout also facilitates integrations with third-party systems, such as container registries and CI platforms.
