Docker Desktop is licensed under the Docker Subscription Service Agreement. When you download and install Docker Desktop, you will be asked to agree to the updated terms.

Our [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) states:

  * Docker Desktop is free for small businesses \(fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue\), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.   * Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.   * Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.   * The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

Read the [Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/) and [Docker subscription FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq) to learn how this may affect companies using Docker Desktop.
