A Docker Hub repository is a collection of container images, enabling you to store, manage, and share Docker images publicly or privately. Each repository serves as a dedicated space where you can store images associated with a particular application, microservice, or project. Content in repositories is organized by tags, which represent different versions of the same application, allowing users to pull the right version when needed.

In this section, learn how to:

  * [Create](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/) a repository.

  * Manage a repository, including how to manage:

    * [Repository information](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/information/): Add descriptions, overviews, and categories to help users understand the purpose and usage of your repository. Clear repository information aids discoverability and usability.

    * [Access](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/access/): Control who can access your repositories with flexible options. Make repositories public or private, add collaborators, and, for organizations, manage roles and teams to maintain security and control.

    * [Images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/hub-images/): Repositories support diverse content types, including OCI artifacts, and allow version control through tagging. Push new images and manage existing content across repositories for flexibility.

    * [Image security insights](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/vulnerability-scanning/): Utilize continuous Docker Scout analysis and static vulnerability scanning to detect, understand, and address security issues within container images.

    * [Webhooks](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/webhooks/): Automate responses to repository events like image pushes or updates by setting up webhooks, which can trigger notifications or actions in external systems, streamlining workflows.

    * [Automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/builds/): Integrate with GitHub or Bitbucket for automated builds. Every code change triggers an image rebuild, supporting continuous integration and delivery.

    * [Trusted content](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/): Contribute to Docker Official Images or manage repositories in the Verified Publisher and Sponsored Open Source programs, including tasks like setting logos, accessing analytics, and enabling vulnerability scanning.

  * [Archive](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/archive/) an outdated or unsupported repository.

  * [Delete](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/delete/) a repository.

  * [Manage personal settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/settings/): For your account, you can set personal settings for repositories, including default repository privacy and autobuild notifications.
