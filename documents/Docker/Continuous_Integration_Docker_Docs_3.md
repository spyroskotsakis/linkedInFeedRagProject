You can analyze Docker images in continuous integration pipelines as you build them using a GitHub action or the Docker Scout CLI plugin.

Available integrations:

  * [GitHub Actions](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/ci/gha/)   * [GitLab](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/ci/gitlab/)   * [Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/ci/azure/)   * [Circle CI](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/ci/circle-ci/)   * [Jenkins](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/ci/jenkins/)

You can also add runtime integration as part of your CI/CD pipeline, which lets you assign an image to an environment, such as `production` or `staging`, when you deploy it. For more information, see [Environment monitoring](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/environment/).
