# Docker Build Cloud: Reclaim your time with fast, multi-architecture builds

Table of contents

* * *

98% of developers spend up to an hour every day waiting for builds to finish \([Incredibuild: 2022 Big Dev Build Times](https://www.incredibuild.com/survey-report-2022)\). Heavy, complex builds can become a major roadblock for development teams, slowing down both local development and CI/CD pipelines.

Docker Build Cloud speeds up image build times to improve developer productivity, reduce frustrations, and help you shorten the release cycle.

## Whoâs this for?

  * Anyone who wants to tackle common causes of slow image builds: limited local resources, slow emulation, and lack of build collaboration across a team.   * Developers working on older machines who want to build faster.   * Development teams working on the same repository who want to cut wait times with a shared cache.   * Developers performing multi-architecture builds who donât want to spend hours configuring and rebuilding for emulators.

## What youâll learn

  * Building container images faster locally and in CI   * Accelerating builds for multi-platform images   * Reusing pre-built images to expedite workflows

## Tools integration

Works well with Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, and other CI solutions
