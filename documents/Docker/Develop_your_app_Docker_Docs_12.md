In the last section, you saw how using Docker Compose, you can connect your services together. In this section, you will learn how to develop the Golang application with Docker. You will also see how to use Docker Compose Watch to rebuild the image whenever you make changes to the code. Lastly, you will test the application and visualize the metrics in Grafana using Prometheus as the data source.

## Developing the application

Now, if you make any changes to your Golang application locally, it needs to reflect in the container, right? To do that, one approach is use the `--build` flag in Docker Compose after making changes in the code. This will rebuild all the services which have the `build` instruction in the `compose.yml` file, in your case, the `api` service \(Golang application\).               docker compose up --build     

But, this is not the best approach. This is not efficient. Every time you make a change in the code, you need to rebuild manually. This is not is not a good flow for development.

The better approach is to use Docker Compose Watch. In the `compose.yml` file, under the service `api`, you have added the `develop` section. So, it's more like a hot reloading. Whenever you make changes to code \(defined in `path`\), it will rebuild the image \(or restart depending on the action\). This is how you can use it:                1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10     11     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     

|                services:       api:         container_name: go-api         build:           context: .           dockerfile: Dockerfile         image: go-api:latest         ports:           - 8000:8000         networks:           - go-network         healthcheck:           test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]           interval: 30s           timeout: 10s           retries: 5         develop:           watch:             - path: .               action: rebuild      ---|---      Once you have added the `develop` section in the `compose.yml` file, you can use the following command to start the development server:               $ docker compose watch     

Now, if you modify your `main.go` or any other file in the project, the `api` service will be rebuilt automatically. You will see the following output in the terminal:               Rebuilding service(s) ["api"] after changes were detected...

## Testing the application

Now that you have your application running, head over to the Grafana dashboard to visualize the metrics you are registering. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will be greeted with the Grafana login page. The login credentials are the ones provided in Compose file.

Once you are logged in, you can create a new dashboard. While creating dashboard you will notice that is default data source is `Prometheus`. This is because you have already configured the data source in the `grafana.yml` file.

You can use different panels to visualize the metrics. This guide doesn't go into details of Grafana. You can refer to the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) for more information. There is a Bar Gauge panel to visualize the total number of requests from different endpoints. You used the `api_http_request_total` and `api_http_request_error_total` metrics to get the data.

![The optional settings screen with the options specified.](https://docs.docker.com/guides/images/grafana-panel.png)

You created this panel to visualize the total number of requests from different endpoints to compare the successful and failed requests. For all the good requests, the bar will be green, and for all the failed requests, the bar will be red. Plus it will also show the from which endpoint the request is coming, either it's a successful request or a failed request. If you want to use this panel, you can import the `dashboard.json` file from the repository you cloned.

## Summary

You've come to the end of this guide. You learned how to develop the Golang application with Docker. You also saw how to use Docker Compose Watch to rebuild the image whenever you make changes to the code. Lastly, you tested the application and visualized the metrics in Grafana using Prometheus as the data source.
