To help ensure consistency across documentation, the Technical Writing team recommends these wording choices.

#### & \(ampersand\)

Don't use `&` instead of `and` in headings, text, navigation, UI copy, or tables of contents.

#### above

Try to avoid using `above` when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use `previous` instead.

For example:

_In the previous example, the dog had fleas._

#### account name

Don't use. Instead, use `username`.

#### admin

Write out `administrator` on first use. Use `admin` if it's the name of a UI label or other element.

#### allows

Don't use. Instead, use `lets`.

#### as of this writing

Avoid because the writing itself implies this phrase. The phrase can also prematurely share product or feature strategy or inappropriately imply that a product or feature might change.

#### below

Try to avoidÂ `below` when referring to an example or table on a documentation page. If required, useÂ `following` instead.

For example:

_In the following example, the dog had fleas._

#### checkbox

Use one word forÂ `checkbox`. Don't useÂ `check box`.

YouÂ selectÂ \(notÂ checkÂ orÂ enable\) andÂ clearÂ \(notÂ deselectÂ orÂ disable\) checkboxes.

#### click

Don't useÂ `click`. Instead, useÂ `select` with buttons, links, menu items, and lists.

SelectÂ applies to more devices, whileÂ click is more specific to a mouse.

#### currently

Don't use `currently` when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today.

#### disable

Don't use `disable`. Implies that disability is a less-desired or negative state.

Instead, use `turn off` or `toggle off`.

There are times with more technical features when the development team uses `disable`, and in these cases, it's OK to use the term.

#### earlier

Use `earlier` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and earlier._

Instead of:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and lower._

#### easy, easily

What might be easy for you might not be easy for others. Try eliminating this word from the sentence because usually the same meaning can be conveyed without it.

#### e.g.

Don't use. Instead, use phrases like `for example` or `such as`.

#### enable

Don't use `enable`. Implies that disability is a less-desired or negative state.

Instead, use `turn on` or `toggle on`.

There are times with more technical features when the development team uses `enable`, and in these cases, it's OK to use the term.

#### execute

Avoid where possible. Use `run` instead.

#### later

Use `later` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and later._

Instead of:

_In Docker Desktop 4.1 and higherâ¦_ or _In Docker Desktop 4.1 and aboveâ¦_

#### please

Don't use `please` in the normal course of explaining how to use a product, even if you're explaining a difficult task. Also don't use the phrase `please note`.

#### register

Use `sign up` instead of register when talking about creating an account.

#### repo

Don't use. Instead, use `repository`.

#### respectively

Avoid `respectively` and be more precise instead.

#### scroll

Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as _move through_ or _navigate to_ instead, if the context is clear.

#### sign in

Use `sign in` instead of `sign on`, `signon`, `log on`, `logon`, or `log in`, `login`. If the user interface uses different words, use those.

Use `sign in to` instead of `sign into`.

#### sign up

Use `sign up` or `create account` instead of `register` when talking about creating an account.

#### tab versus view

Use `view` when referring to a major section in a UI. Use `tab` when referring to a sub-section in the UI.

For example, in Docker Desktop, the **Images** view and the **Local** tab.

#### toggle

You turn on or turn off a toggle. For example:

_Turn on the dark mode toggle._

#### upgrade

Use `upgrade` when describing a higher subscription tier

#### vs

Don't use `vs` or `vs.` as an abbreviation for versus; instead, use the unabbreviated `versus`.

#### we

Try to avoid `we` and focus instead on how the user can carry out something in Docker.

Use:

_Use widgets when you have work you want to organize._

Instead of:

_We created a feature for you to add widgets._

#### wish

Don't use. Use `want` instead.
