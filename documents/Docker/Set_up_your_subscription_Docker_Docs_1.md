## Set up a Docker subscription for a personal account

After you [create your Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/), you have a Docker Personal subscription. To continue using this subscription, no further action is necessary. For additional features, you can upgrade to a Docker Pro subscription.

To upgrade from Docker Personal to Docker Pro, see [Upgrade your subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/#upgrade-your-subscription).

## Set up a Docker subscription for an organization

You can subscribe a new or existing organization to a Docker subscription. Only organization owners can manage billing for the organization.

After you [create your Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/), you have a Docker Personal subscription. You must then create an organization and choose a subscription for it. For more details, see [Create your organization](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/orgs/).

To learn how to upgrade a Docker subscription for an existing organization, see [Upgrade your subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/#upgrade-your-subscription).
