The Python language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Python application using Docker. In this guide, youâll learn how to:

  * Containerize and run a Python application   * Set up a local environment to develop a Python application using containers   * Lint, format, typing and best practices   * Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Python application using GitHub Actions   * Deploy your containerized Python application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing Python application.
