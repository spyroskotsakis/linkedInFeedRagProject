For more information on Docker subscriptions, see [Docker subscription overview](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/).

### Can I transfer my subscription from one user or organization account to another?

Subscriptions are non-transferable.

### Can I pause or delay my Docker subscription?

You can't pause or delay a subscription, but you can [downgrade](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/). If a subscription invoice hasn't been paid on the due date, there's a 15 day grace period, including the due date.

### Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### What ways can I contribute to Docker content?

Docker offers two programs:

  * [Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program \(DSOS\)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dsos-program/)   * [Docker Verified Publisher \(DVP\)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dvp-program/)

You can also join the [Developer Preview Program](https://www.docker.com/community/get-involved/developer-preview/) or sign up for early access programs for specific products to participate in research and try out new features.
