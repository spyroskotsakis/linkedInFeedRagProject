> Warning >  > Uninstalling Docker Desktop destroys Docker containers, images, volumes, and other Docker-related data local to the machine, and removes the files generated by the application. To learn how to preserve important data before uninstalling, refer to the [back up and restore data](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/backup-and-restore/) section.

Windows  Mac  Ubuntu  Debian  Fedora  Arch

#### From the GUI

  1. From the Windows **Start** menu, select **Settings** > **Apps** > **Apps & features**.   2. Select **Docker Desktop** from the **Apps & features** list and then select **Uninstall**.   3. Select **Uninstall** to confirm your selection.

#### From the CLI

  1. Locate the installer:                    $ C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop Installer.exe          

  2. Uninstall Docker Desktop.

  * In PowerShell, run:                  $ Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait uninstall         

  * In the Command Prompt, run:                  $ start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" uninstall         

After uninstalling Docker Desktop, some residual files may remain which you can remove manually. These are:               C:\ProgramData\Docker     C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop     C:\Program Files\Docker     C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Local\Docker     C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Docker     C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Docker Desktop     C:\Users\<your user name>\.docker     

#### From the GUI

  1. Open Docker Desktop.   2. In the top-right corner of the Docker Desktop Dashboard, select the **Troubleshoot** icon.   3. Select **Uninstall**.   4. When prompted, confirm by selecting **Uninstall** again.

You can then move the Docker application to the trash.

#### From the CLI

Run:               $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall     

You can then move the Docker application to the trash.

> Note >  > You may encounter the following error when uninstalling Docker Desktop using the uninstall command. >      >      >     $ /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/uninstall >     Password: >     Uninstalling Docker Desktop... >     Error: unlinkat /Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/.com.apple.containermanagerd.metadata.plist: > operation not permitted >      >  > The operation not permitted error is reported either on the file `.com.apple.containermanagerd.metadata.plist` or on the parent directory `/Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/`. This error can be ignored as you have successfully uninstalled Docker Desktop. You can remove the directory `/Users/<USER_HOME>/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/` later by allowing **Full Disk Access** to the terminal application you are using \(**System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Full Disk Access**\).

After uninstalling Docker Desktop, some residual files may remain which you can remove:               $ rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker     $ rm -rf ~/.docker     

With Docker Desktop version 4.36 and earlier, the following files may also be left on the file system. You can remove these with administrative privileges:               /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd     /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.socket     

To uninstall Docker Desktop for Ubuntu:

  1. Remove the Docker Desktop application. Run:                    $ sudo apt remove docker-desktop          

This removes the Docker Desktop package itself but doesnât delete all of its files or settings.

  2. Manually remove leftover file.                    $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop          $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli          $ sudo apt purge docker-desktop          

This removes configuration and data files at `$HOME/.docker/desktop`, the symlink at `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`, and purges the remaining systemd service files.

  3. Clean up Docker config settings. In `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, remove the `credsStore` and `currentContext` properties.

These entries tell Docker where to store credentials and which context is active. If they remain after uninstalling Docker Desktop, they may conflict with a future Docker setup.

To uninstall Docker Desktop for Debian, run:

  1. Remove the Docker Desktop application:                    $ sudo apt remove docker-desktop

  2. Manually remove leftover file.                    $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop          $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli          $ sudo apt purge docker-desktop          

This removes configuration and data files at `$HOME/.docker/desktop`, the symlink at `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`, and purges the remaining systemd service files.

  3. Clean up Docker config settings. In `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, remove the `credsStore` and `currentContext` properties.

To uninstall Docker Desktop for Fedora:

  1. Remove the Docker Desktop application. Run:                    $ sudo dnf remove docker-desktop          

This removes the Docker Desktop package itself but doesnât delete all of its files or settings.

  2. Manually remove leftover file.                    $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop          $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli          $ sudo apt purge docker-desktop          

This removes configuration and data files at `$HOME/.docker/desktop`, the symlink at `/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli`, and purges the remaining systemd service files.

To uninstall Docker Desktop for Arch:

  1. Remove the Docker Desktop application. Run:                    $ sudo pacman -Rns docker-desktop          

This removes the Docker Desktop package along with its configuration files and dependencies not required by other packages.

  2. Manually remove leftover files.                    $ rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop          

This removes configuration and data files at `$HOME/.docker/desktop`.
