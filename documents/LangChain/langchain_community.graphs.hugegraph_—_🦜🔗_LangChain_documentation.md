Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling             code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation             of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such             data is present in the database.             The best way to guard against such negative outcomes is to (as appropriate)             limit the permissions granted to the credentials used with this tool.
