Create an agent that uses self-ask with search prompting.

Parameters:     

  * **llm** \([_BaseLanguageModel_](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/language_models/langchain_core.language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel.html#langchain_core.language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel "langchain_core.language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel")\) â€“ LLM to use as the agent.

  * **tools** \(_Sequence_ _\[_[_BaseTool_](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/tools/langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool.html#langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool "langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool") _\]_\) â€“ List of tools. Should just be of length 1, with that tool having name Intermediate Answer

  * **prompt** \([_BasePromptTemplate_](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.base.BasePromptTemplate.html#langchain_core.prompts.base.BasePromptTemplate "langchain_core.prompts.base.BasePromptTemplate")\) â€“ The prompt to use, must have input key agent\_scratchpad which will contain agent actions and tool outputs.

Returns:     

A Runnable sequence representing an agent. It takes as input all the same input variables as the prompt passed in does. It returns as output either an AgentAction or AgentFinish.

Return type:     

[_Runnable_](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable.html#langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable "langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable")
