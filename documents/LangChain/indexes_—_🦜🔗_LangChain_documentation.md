# `indexes`\#

**Index** is used to avoid writing duplicated content into the vectostore and to avoid over-writing content if itâ€™s unchanged.

Indexes also :

  * Create knowledge graphs from data.

  * Support indexing workflows from LangChain data loaders to vectorstores.

Importantly, Index keeps on working even if the content being written is derived via a set of transformations from some source content \(e.g., indexing children documents that were derived from parent documents by chunking.\)
